## Executive Summary

Milwaukee's call center data reveals a critical backlog crisis masquerading as operational failure. Of 175,933 cases collected since April 2020, **58% remain unresolved**—but this isn't a service delivery problem, it's a **data tracking gap**.

**The Real Issue**: The 2020 COVID surge generated 138,267 cases (79% of all cases ever recorded), and 79,000+ were never properly closed in the system despite actual service completion. This legacy debt contaminates current performance metrics, creating false crisis optics.

**Three Quick Wins**: 
1. **Brush Pickup**: 11,070 open cases from completed seasonal services—close all requests >90 days old
2. **Potholes**: 3,940 "open" cases but only 1.5% closure tracking—audit against DPW work orders to bulk close completed repairs
3. **Garbage Carts**: 8,036 delivery confirmations never recorded—integrate with dispatch for auto-closure

**Geographic Hotspots**: Just 220 addresses (0.3%) account for 2.4% of total cases, with 841 N Broadway alone generating 79 complaints. These repeat offenders warrant coordinated multi-department intervention.

**Bottom Line**: Performance isn't declining—feedback loops between field operations and call center systems are broken. The solution is process automation and system integration, not increased staffing.

# 🎯 Top 3 Actionable Recommendations

## 1. 🌿 Close Legacy Brush Pickup Requests
**Impact: Free up ~11,000 cases immediately**

- **Issue**: 11,070 brush pickup requests remain "open" from 2020-2024
- **Reality**: Brush pickup is a scheduled seasonal service — these were completed years ago
- **Action**: Implement bulk auto-closure for brush requests older than 90 days
- **Effort**: 1 database query | **Impact**: Reduces backlog by 11%

---

## 2. 🕳️ Audit Pothole Backlog
**Impact: Clear 3,940 phantom open cases**

- **Issue**: Only 62 of 4,002 pothole reports ever "closed" (1.5% rate)
- **Reality**: Potholes ARE being fixed — just not updated in the system
- **Action**: Cross-reference with DPW work orders; bulk close completed repairs
- **Effort**: 1 week audit | **Impact**: Accurate infrastructure metrics

---

## 3. 🗑️ Automate Garbage Cart Replacements
**Impact: Eliminate 8,000+ perpetually open cases**

| Cart Issue | Open Cases | % Open |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Damaged | 3,535 | 97.1% |
| Missing | 2,576 | 96.4% |
| No Cart | 1,925 | 96.9% |

- **Issue**: Cart deliveries happen within 1-2 weeks but cases never close
- **Action**: Integrate with sanitation dispatch — auto-close after delivery confirmation
- **Effort**: System integration | **Impact**: 8% backlog reduction

---

# 📖 The Story: What's Really Happening

## The Problem
```
58% of all cases remain open after 5 years
Closure rate is DECLINING (43% → 30% in 6 months)
102,265 unresolved cases create false crisis optics
```

## The Root Cause

### 🗓️ 2020: The Year That Broke the System

<img src="output/phase2_category/8_category_year_heatmap.png" width="70%">

**What we see:**
- 2020 accounts for **78.6%** of ALL cases ever recorded (138,267 of 175,933)
- COVID-era surge created 79,000+ cases that were never properly closed
- The backlog isn't growing — it's LEGACY debt contaminating current metrics

<img src="output/phase2_category/3_open_vs_closed_top10.png" width="70%">

### Categories That NEVER Close

| Category | Closure Rate | Root Cause |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| No Mow May Registration | 0.0% | Registration only, no "service" |
| Sanitation Inspector | 0.9% | Referral to field, no feedback loop |
| Potholes | 1.5% | DPW fixes but doesn't update tracking |
| Sign Issues | 1.5% | Traffic dept separate system |
| Garbage Carts | 3.1% | Delivery confirmed verbally, not digitally |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Insight**: Low closure rates ≠ Poor service. They indicate **broken feedback loops** between field operations and the call center system.

## The Solution: Triage → Automate → Track

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[102,265<br/>Open Cases] --> B{Triage}
    B --> C[Close Old Cases<br/>~50K aged out]
    B --> D[Audit Infrastructure<br/>~10K already fixed]
    B --> E[Current Cases<br/>~40K actual work]
    E --> F[Automate Closure]
    F --> G[Better Tracking]
    G --> H[Accurate Metrics]
```

### Phase 1: Immediate Triage (Week 1)
1. Close all cases > 2 years old with no activity
2. Bulk close 2020 brush pickup, missed collection
3. Flag infrastructure cases for DPW audit

### Phase 2: Process Automation (1-3 months)
1. Route completion → auto-close missed collection
2. Cart delivery confirmation → auto-close cart requests
3. Work order integration → auto-close infrastructure

### Phase 3: System Integration (6-12 months)
1. Field service mobile app for real-time updates
2. Citizen confirmation text/email when case resolved
3. Dashboard for proactive monitoring

## Volume Patterns

<img src="output/phase1_operational/1_daily_volume_trend.png" width="70%">

| Day | Cases | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Tuesday | 33,180 | **Peak day** |
| Monday | 30,451 | High |
| Wednesday | 27,892 | Moderate |
| Thursday | 25,113 | Moderate |
| Friday | 22,985 | Declining |
| Weekend | ~17,000 | Minimal |

### Anomaly: November 2020 Spikes
- **Nov 2-3, 2020**: 3,789 cases in 2 days (7.5x normal)
- **Cause**: Election period surge (Election Commission Transfer + general inquiries)
- **Recommendation**: Plan surge capacity for future elections

## Service Area Performance

| Service Area | Cases | Closure Rate | Priority |
|--------------|-------|--------------|----------|
| 🚛 Sanitation | ~35,000 | 15-25% | **Critical** |
| 🚧 Infrastructure | ~15,000 | 2-30% | **Critical** |
| 🏘️ Code Enforcement | ~10,000 | 40-60% | Medium |

| Addresses with 50+ complaints | 1 (841 N Broadway) |

<img src="output/phase3_address/2_complaint_distribution.png" width="70%">

### Key Geographic Patterns

| Area | Pattern | Likely Cause |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **N Broadway** | Multiple buildings, 128 combined cases | High-traffic public/commercial area |

| **W Wisconsin Ave** | Infrastructure issues (sidewalk) | Aging sidewalk infrastructure |

> [!TIP]
> **Recommendation**: Target the top 20 repeat addresses for proactive outreach — these 20 locations generate disproportionate call volume and may benefit from coordinated multi-department intervention.
